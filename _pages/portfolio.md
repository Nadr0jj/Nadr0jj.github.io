## Data Science
### [:link: doihaveatumor.com](https://github.com/Nadr0jj/DATA515-Brain-Scan-Classification)
The Brain Scan Classifier is a machine learning project that classifies 2D brain scan images as tumorous or not. Our website allows users to upload their own (.jpg, jpeg, or .png) photos into the model, and get a prediction result. Note that the website is not currently deployed, but all of the code is available on github.

### [:link: Deriving insights w/ real-time pricing data](https://github.com/Nadr0jj/osrs_api_data_exploration/blob/main/osrs_api_data_exploration.ipynb)
A Jupyter notebook in which I explore what can be done with real-time pricing data for the MMO game Runescape made available by WeirdGloop LLC via an API.

### [:link: Exploring bias on the English Wikipedia](https://github.com/Nadr0jj/English-wikipedia-bias)
A Jupyter notebook in which I explore the potential for bias present in English Wikipedia articles using machine learning to determine article quality.

## Software
### [:link: disam](https://github.com/Nadr0jj/disam)
disam is a Python package for on-**di**sk **sam**pling with a C++ backend (and a pure Python fallback). The intended use case for disam is when datasets cannot be loaded in to memory either due to size or memory constraints.

### [:link: SofaBrute](https://github.com/Nadr0jj/SofaBrute)
SofaBrute is a tool written in Python which aims to help researchers understand the rotation path of the (conjectured) omptimal sofa as a function of the hallway angle. SofaBrute does this by "brute forcing" (see algorithm section of repo) its way to a (conjectured) optimal sofa, and then saving plots of the sofa in the hallway at various points through its rotation to the local folder.

## Novelty

### [:link: sarcastic_gd](https://github.com/Nadr0jj/sarcastic_gd)
Stochastic gradient descent is well known for it's convergence garauntees and simple algorithm. However, one thing it's not known for is its ability to mock the user while it learns. Introducing sarcastic gradient descent: sarcastic-stochastic learning with just one line.
