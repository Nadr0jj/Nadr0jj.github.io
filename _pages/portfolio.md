SofaBrute is a tool written in Python which aims to help researchers understand the rotation path of the (conjectured) omptimal sofa as a function of the hallway angle. SofaBrute does this by "brute forcing" (see algorithm section of repo) its way to a (conjectured) optimal sofa, and then saving plots of the sofa in the hallway at various points through its rotation to the local folder.
