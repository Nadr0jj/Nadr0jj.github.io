[Click here to see my portfolio.](https://nadr0jj.github.io/portfolio/)

I am a graduate student at the **University of Washington, Seattle** where I am earning my **MSc** in **Data Science**. I previously earned my BS in Mathematics and Scientific Computation from the University of California, Davis. 

My work experience includes developing **data visualization software** for **Rush Midwest Orthopedics** which is currently used by **Major League Baseball** teams in their return-to-pitching programs. A lifetime ago I was a project manager at Capitol Campaigns (Sacramento, CA) where I ran political events for local politicians. 

I am passionate about using statistical approaches to drive insights, developing machine learning models, fairness in machine learning contexts, and writing maintainable code. My primary tools for doing these things are Python, SQL, and Jupyter notebooks. I am proficient with the Python packages Pandas, Numpy, and Pytorch.

In my free time I enjoy training deep learning models, and I'm passionate about angling.
