`  `

I am a graduate student at the **University of Washington, Seattle** where I am earning my **MSc** in **Data Science**. I previously earned my **BS** in **Mathematics and Scientific Computation** from the **University of California, Davis**. 

My work experience includes developing **data visualization software** for **Rush Midwest Orthopedics** which is currently used by Major League Baseball teams in their return-to-pitching programs. A lifetime ago I was a project manager at Capitol Campaigns (Sacramento, CA) where I ran political events for local politicians.
